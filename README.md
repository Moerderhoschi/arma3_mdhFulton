Fulton Recovery is a mod, created by Moerderhoschi for Arma III, to enable a fulton recovery like in MGSV for units and vehicles.

HOW THE ADDON WORKS?

1x. At missionstart sleep 3 seconds and Check all units/vehicles if anybody has the special variable assigned mdhFulton

2a. if variable not assigned, add fulton actionmenu entry to all units/vehicles

2b. if variable is assigned, add fulton actionmenu entry only to units with assigned variable

3x. sleep 5 seconds and start check from beginning

WHAT HAPPENS TO THE FULTON RECOVERED UNIT/VEHICLE?

The unit/vehicle gets lifted to 4.000 meter and then deleted

HOW TO USE IT
- Variant A: only load the addon and play -> all units/vehicles have fulton action
- Variant B: set the special variable ( this setVariable [ "mdhFulton" , ["actionTitle"] ] ) to any unit/vehicle -> specific units will have fulton action

FEATURES
- Attach Fulton Recovery device to units and vehicles
- ability to enable Fulton Recovery only for specific units
- now MP-compatible
- added parachute to players which get fulton recovered
- NEW: added the feature of a dropoff point when a player created a marker on the map named fulton

KNOWN ISSUES

dead units don't get correct attached to the parachute, i think it's an engine related problem
